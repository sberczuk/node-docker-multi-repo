Goals
Update and yarn install projects based on a Docker Compose file.

`node index.js --help` gives usage.

This is mean to be a simple way to ensure that you have checked out every project you need and also that it is on the correct branch and up to date.

Unlike other tools, this sources its list of required projects from the docker compose file that will run the project.
